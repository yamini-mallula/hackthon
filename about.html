            <h2>Why Donate Food?</h2>
            <p> India, with a population of over 1.3 billion, has seen tremendous growth in the past two decades. Gross Domestic Product has increased 4.5 times and per capita consumption has increased 3 times. Similarly, food grain production has increased almost 2 times. However, despite phenomenal industrial and economic growth and while India produces sufficient food to feed its population, it is unable to provide access to food to a large number of people, especially women and children.</p>
            <p>it is estimated that nearly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year gets lost or wasted. 40 percent of the fruits and vegetables, and 30 percent of cereals that are produced are lost due to inefficient supply chain management and do not reach the consumer markets. Such food could be saved by timely withdrawing it from the distribution network, aggregating it and then redirecting it to the people in need.</p>
            <p id="additional-info" class="hidden">
                Whether you are a donor contributing to our Food Drive or someone in need
                seeking support through our Community Meal Exchange, every meal shared
                creates a positive ripple effect in our community.
            </p>
            <p>Donating food is a simple yet powerful way to make a positive impact in your community. 
                It helps provide nutritious meals to those in need and reduces food waste. Your contribution 
                can make a significant difference in the lives of individuals and families facing food insecurity.
            </p>
            <p>Join us in the mission to create a hunger-free community. Every donation counts, and 
                together, we can make sure that no one goes to bed hungry.
